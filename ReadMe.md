# PlatformIO Xcode Templates

With this template you can develop PlatformIO and Arduino Projects directly in Xcode. It uses the PlatformIO CLI and doesn't use Makefiles, so you have cleaner projects.

This Template uses CoolTerm as its serial monitor. It is free to use and you can download it here:
http://freeware.the-meiers.org

## Installation:
Copy the files to
```~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/PlatformIO```

Download and drag the [CoolTerm](http://freeware.the-meiers.org) app into your Applications folder

## Usage:
Open Xcode -> New Project -> PlatformIO -> PlatformIO Project

## Add new boards:
This template supports all boards PlatformIO supports. You can add them automatically to your project and optional to the template yourself. Just run the target 'Add Board' and you will be guided to add it.
